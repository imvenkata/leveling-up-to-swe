## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers:
- Track changes in source code.
- Collaborate with others in a team.
- Roll back to previous versions when needed.

Key benefits of Git:
- **Distributed**: Each developer has the full repository on their local machine.
- **Efficient**: Optimized for both large and small projects.
- **Collaborative**: Enables seamless teamwork.

## Repositories

A repository (repo) is a folder managed by Git to track changes.

### Creating a Repository

1. Create a directory for your repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/repos
   cd ~/repos
   ```

2. Initialize a new Git repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir example
   cd example
   git init
   ```

> A hidden `.git` folder is created to store all version control data.

### Cloning an Existing Repository

To work on an existing project:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

---

## Commits

Commits are snapshots of changes made to files in a repository.

### Making a Commit

1. Edit files in your project.

2. Stage the changes:
   ```bash
   git add <filename>
   ```
   Or stage all changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit with a message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe the changes"
   ```

### Viewing Commit History

View the history of commits in your repository:
```bash
git log
```
For a concise view:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## Viewing History

Git lets you "travel back in time" by checking out previous commits.

### Viewing Commit History

1. Show commit history:
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

2. View differences between commits:
   ```bash
   git diff <commit-hash1> <commit-hash2>
   ```

### Checking Out Previous Commits

To view the state of a specific commit:
```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
```
> **Note**: This puts your repository in a detached HEAD state.

Return to the latest commit:
```bash
git checkout master
```

---

## Branches

Branches allow you to work on separate features or fixes without affecting the main project.

### Working with Branches

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git branch <branch-name>
   ```

2. Switch to a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

3. Combine creation and switching:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

4. List all branches:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

5. Delete a branch:
   ```bash
   git branch -d <branch-name>
   ```

---

## Merging Branches

Merge integrates changes from one branch into another.

### Steps to Merge

1. Switch to the branch you want to merge into:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

2. Merge another branch:
   ```bash
   git merge <branch-name>
   ```

---

## Handling Merge Conflicts

Conflicts occur when changes in two branches affect the same line in a file.

### Resolving Conflicts

1. Open the file and locate conflict markers:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your changes
   =======
   Incoming changes
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```

2. Edit the file to keep the desired changes.

3. Stage the resolved file:
   ```bash
   git add <filename>
   ```

4. Commit the resolution:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
   ```

---

## Tags

Tags mark specific commits, often used for releases.

### Working with Tags

1. Create a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag <tag-name>
   ```

2. Annotate a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a <tag-name> -m "Message about the tag"
   ```

3. Push tags to a remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin <tag-name>
   ```

4. List all tags:
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```

5. Delete a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -d <tag-name>
   ```

---

## Stashing

Stashing saves your uncommitted changes temporarily.

### Using Stashes

1. Stash your changes:
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

2. List all stashes:
   ```bash
   git stash list
   ```

3. Apply the latest stash:
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

4. Apply a specific stash:
   ```bash
   git stash apply stash@{0}
   ```

---

## Remote Repositories

Remote repositories facilitate collaboration.

### Common Commands

1. Link a remote repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```

2. Push changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

3. Pull changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin <branch-name>
   ```

4. Fetch changes without merging:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

## Best Practices

- **Commit Often**: Commit changes regularly with meaningful messages.
- **Use Branches**: Isolate features, fixes, and experiments.
- **Sync Frequently**: Pull changes from the remote repository often.
- **Write Clear Messages**: Commit messages should explain the "why" of changes.
- **Resolve Conflicts Carefully**: Test your changes after resolving conflicts.
- **Avoid Large Commits**: Break work into smaller, manageable chunks.
